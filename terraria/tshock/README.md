# TShock

TShock provides Terraria servers with server-side characters, anti-cheat, and community management tools. https://tshock.co/

### From their GitHub
TShock is a toolbox for Terraria servers and communities. That toolbox is jam packed with anti-cheat tools, server-side characters, groups, permissions, item bans, tons of commands, and limitless potential. It's one of a kind.

### Server Ports
TShock, like Terraria, only requires a single port to run. The default is 7777

| Port    | default |
|---------|---------|
| Game    | 7777    |

Plugins may require ports to be added to the server.
