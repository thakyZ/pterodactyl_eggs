**NOTE**
To download the base game, you need to authenticate against steam.
Because of the normaly active Steamgaurd protection, it is important to enter the Steamgaurd code.
When the initial install is finished, you need to enter the Steamguard code which is sent to you by mail and reinstall the Server again.

This only works if you get you Steamguard code via mail. The authenticator app is not supported.

## Server Ports
The nitrox server requires only the default Server port.


|   Port  | default |
|---------|---------|
| Server  |  any |
