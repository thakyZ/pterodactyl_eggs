# Prometheus

### From the [Prometheus](https://www.mongodb.com/) GitHub repository
The Prometheus monitoring system and time series database.

### Resource consumption
As this is a database software, it can take up massive amounts of disk space. Due to Prometheus design, a huge memory consumption is also possible.
To get started, a minimum of 3GB RAM and >=2.5GB disk space is recommended.
Keep in mind that those numbers can grow pretty quick for large monitored environments!

### Server Ports
Ports required to run the server in a table format.

| Port              | default |
|-------------------|---------|
| Prometheus server | 9090    |
