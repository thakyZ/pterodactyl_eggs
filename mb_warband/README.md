# Mount & Blade Warband

Mount & Blade: Warband is a stand alone expansion pack for the game that brought medieval battlefields to life with its realistic mounted combat and detailed fighting system. Many modifications have been developed to bring the Warband universe into different eras, including the popular Napoleonic Wars DLC, among many others, featuring battles of up to concurrent 200 players.

### Server Ports

Warband requires a single port (default 7240)

| Port    | default |
|---------|---------|
| Game    | 7240    |

### Other Notes

* The server can only use the main IP address of the node due to limitations in the way Warband's server reporting system operates, no alias or secondary IP addresses can be used.
* A complete list of modules supported by this egg can be found [here](https://github.com/masonr/pterodactyl-images/tree/mb-warband), the module name will need to be copied exactly as shown.
* The current module can be changed at any time and will automatically download the new files upon restart after changing the module name
