# Forge Generic

### This is a generic egg for curseforge modpacks

You will need to give it a modpack URL such as `https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/<modpack_name>`

This will grabe the latest release when the version is set to latest. 

It "should" grab versions of the pack based on the modpack version numbers
