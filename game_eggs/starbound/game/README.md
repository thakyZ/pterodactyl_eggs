# Starbound

## From their [Website](https://playstarbound.org/)

Vanilla Starbound egg. Currently up to 1.4.4 is supported, however future patches will require updates to the install script.

## Install notes

Due to rate limiting the console on the panel cannot keep up with the game console and the build will complete before the panel console may show it. Reloading the console will load it to the latest part of the log.

## Minimum RAM warning

You may want to assign a minimum of ? mb of RAM to a server as it will use around ? mb to generate the world on the first start.

## Server Ports

Starbound required ports to run

| Port    | default |
|---------|---------|
| Game    | 25125   |

## Extra Information

If you want to download mods in the console, the startup command has to be changed.

New startup:
`./starbound_server`
