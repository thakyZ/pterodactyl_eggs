# Parkers Pterodactyl eggs repo

I am working on adding a large collection of public eggs for the Pterodactyl community.

With that I am also accepting PR's for new service and also updates to the current ones.

If you are submitting PR's try and keep names and titles the same.


## Current Game Eggs
### GTA
#### FiveM
The [FiveM](https://fivem.net/) GTA 5 dedicated server

### Factorio
#### factorio
The [Factorio](https://factorio.com/) dedicated server

### Terraria
#### tShock
The [tShock](https://tshock.co) modded server

### Minecraft
#### Spigot
This is a direct fork of the default spigot service with the added benefit of being able to build the spigot jar.
(It's noted that building the jar is intensive and time consuming)
