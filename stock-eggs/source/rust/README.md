# [Rust](https://rust.facepunch.com/)

The only aim in Rust is to survive. To do this you will need to overcome struggles such as hunger, thirst and cold. Build a fire. Build a shelter. Kill animals for meat. Protect yourself from other players, and kill them for meat. Create alliances with other players and form a town. Do whatever it takes to survive. 

#### Port Requirements
The Rust server requires 3 ports minimum.
