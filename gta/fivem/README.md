# FiveM 

# Notice

This is to inform all users that the4 fivem team has enabled cloudflare ddos protection and the install script is now broken due to this.

You will need to have a self hosted version of the server files to curl in the install script.

I have added a `DOWNLOAD_URL` variable that needs to point to a `fx.tar.xz` file as I am too lazy to update the entire script.

### From the [FiveM](https://fivem.net/) Site
FiveM is a modification for Grand Theft Auto V enabling you to play multiplayer on customized dedicated servers.

### Install notes
- Only installs latest version versions are not selectable.

### Server Ports
Ports required to run the server in a table format.

| Port    | default |
|---------|---------|
